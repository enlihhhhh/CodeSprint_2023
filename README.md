## ℹ Background and Introduction
> *"PSA operates the world’s largest transhipment hub in Singapore, facilitating cargo movement across the world all year round. This has enabled complex trade flows in the supply chain, which drive our economies and sustain the pulse of our societies. However, in recent years, the supply chain and logistics industry face disruptions from geopolitical tensions, inflation, and pandemics. This, coupled with a growing concern on carbon emissions from transporting cargo, demand solutions that can increase the resilience, agility, and sustainability of supply chains around the world. Being a global leader in the port and logistics industry, we envision to create an Internet of Logistics for the industry, enabling collaboration among the stakeholders in both the port and logistics ecosystems, by leveraging on data and smart technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)."* 

## ❓ Problem Statement
> How can digital solutions powered by data and AI optimize demand and supply in the logistics ecosystem for seamless flow of cargo?

## 💡 Solution
> A Deep Learning and Machine Learning based solution accompanied by Data Science to determine containers demand forecasting based on a Forward-Feed Neural Network trained Model and container utilisation allocation based on a First-Fit Algorithm.
